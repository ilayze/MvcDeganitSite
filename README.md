## Development Documentation for VirtuClass:  

### How to get the code? 
The original source is available through the mail of the author Ilay Zeidman. 
In addition the source code is available in the project page in the repository.

### Locate information about a directory structure and files?  
There are documentations in the classes about each variable, function and class  
and in our very user friendly wiki page. 

### How to prepare a new version?  
Each time a new version is released it will be published in a new folder with the new version number, and its updates.  
The new version is supposed to solve all the bugs that were found on the earlier releases

### Project License:
Our project license will be GNU GPL-General Public License , The GPL is the first copyleft license for general use, which means that derived works can only be distributed under the same license terms.  
Under this philosophy, the GPL grants the recipients of a computer program the rights of the free software definition and uses copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved, even when the work is changed or added to.  
This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples.
